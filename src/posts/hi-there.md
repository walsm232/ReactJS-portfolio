So, 2026 is here and I've finally decided to stop being a lurker and actually write some stuff down. After a few years of working in software engineering, platform engineering, and the cloud-native space, I've made enough mistakes and (hopefully) learned enough things that maybe someone else might find them useful (or at the very least, entertaining).

## Who am I?

I'm Michael, a Software Engineer from Ireland 🇮🇪 who somehow ended up in Spain for now 🇪🇸. Funnily enough, I ended up where I am because I studied Enterprise Computing (sort of like a mix of computer science + business) after not really knowing what I wanted to do in university. Initially I hated it, but over time I began to love it.

At the time of writing, I'm at Elastic working on platform engineering, focusing on platform tooling and developer experience to try to make developer's lives easier. Previously, I spent time at Workday building similar developer tooling and platform capabilities.

I also co-founded the Kubernetes Dublin Meetup back in 2023, which somehow grew to 900+ members. We got accepted as the Cloud Native Computing Foundation (CNCF) Community Group for Dublin in 2024 and hosted various local + international speakers, which was pretty cool. I'm still not entirely sure how that all happened, but here we are.

## Why am I doing this?

I've been reading and learning from blog posts and articles for years, and I've found that the ones that resonate most with me are the ones that focus on real-world experiences, the practical stuff that actually works (and the things that definitely don't), the weird bugs you encounter at 2am, the "why did we do it this way?" moments, and the occasional "wait, that actually worked?" victories.

I've made a lot of mistakes, learned from some of them, and I'm still learning every day. So I figure I might as well share what I've picked up along the way.

## What you'll find here

I'm planning to write about:

- **Software Engineering**: The good, the bad, and the "why is this so complicated?" parts of building software
- **Platform Engineering**: Making developer's lives easier (or at least trying to), building internal tools, and dealing with some of the interesting complexity associated with Kubernetes
- **Cloud-Native Stuff**: Kubernetes deep dives, containerization, observability, security, networking, service mesh, and whatever else in the CNCF ecosystem catches my attention
- **The Industry**: Career stuff, team dynamics, industry trends, and my hot takes on whatever's happening in tech

I'm not promising to be an expert on everything (or anything, really), but I'll share what I know, what I'm learning, and what I think about it all. Sometimes I'll be right, sometimes I'll be wrong, and sometimes I'll just be ✨ confused ✨. But that's all part of the job.

## Let's see how this goes

I'm committing to writing more in 2026. No promises on frequency. But I'll try to share things that are actually useful or at the very least mildly entertaining.
